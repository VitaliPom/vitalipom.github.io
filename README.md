# clock - we've got a Screensaver!!!
###Preview link doesn't work, JQuery isn't loaded. To view, download ZIP to any desktop folder and open clock_0 folder for full experience also view in 24' screen. 

<p>https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/VitaliPom/clock/blob/master/clock_0/time_0.html
<p>directories clock_0 clock_1 are the ones who has butterflies udpated animations and therefore they are the ones who should be used for proper full screen use.

<p>UPDATE: on screen saver more /clock_0/1 butterflies creates lagging effect, do not use them anyways!
